# Verba Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the Verba community! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the Verba project. Verba is a collaborative open-source project, and we believe that everyone has something unique to contribute. Below you'll find our guidelines which aim to make contributing to Verba a respectful and pleasant experience for everyone.

## 🌟 Community and Open Source

Open source is at the heart of Verba. We appreciate feedback, ideas, and enhancements from the community. Whether you're looking to fix a bug, add a new feature, or simply improve the documentation, your contribution is important to us.

## 📚 Before You Begin

Before contributing, please take a moment to read through the [README](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba/README.md) and the [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba/TECHNICAL.md). These documents provide a comprehensive understanding of the project and are essential reading to ensure that we're all on the same page.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

If you've identified a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please begin by creating an Issue. Here's how:

- Check the Issue tracker to ensure the bug or enhancement hasn't already been reported.
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
- Include as much relevant information as possible.

## 💡 Ideas and Feedback

We welcome all ideas and feedback. If you're not ready to open an Issue or if you're just looking for a place to discuss ideas, head over to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba/discussions) or the [Weaviate Support Page](https://forum.weaviate.io/).

## 📝 Pull Requests

If you're ready to contribute code or documentation, please submit a Pull Request (PR) to the dev branch. Here's the process:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Ensure that your code adheres to the existing code style. Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting Python code.
- If you're adding a new feature, consider writing unit tests and documenting the feature.
- Verify that your changes pass existing unit tests
- Make sure your code lints (mypy compatibility is optional but encouraged).
- Include a clear description of your changes in the PR.
- Link to the Issue in your PR description.

### 🧪 Tests and Formatting

To maintain the quality of the codebase, we ask that all contributors:

- Run unit tests to ensure that nothing is broken.
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format your code before submitting.

### 🔄 Pull Request Process

- PRs are reviewed on a regular basis.
- Engage in the conversation and make requested updates to your PR if needed.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch by a maintainer.

## 🗨️ Stay Connected

We encourage you to join our community channels. Stay connected, share ideas, and get to know fellow contributors.

Thank you for being a part of Verba. Your contributions not only help improve the project but also the wider community of users and developers.
